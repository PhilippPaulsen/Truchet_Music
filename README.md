# **Truchet_Music**
An interactive web-based tool for exploring symmetry, music, and visual art. This project combines p5.js and Tone.js to create dynamic visual patterns and generative music, offering a creative playground for enthusiasts and educators.

## **Features**
- Create symmetric patterns using multiple symmetry types (e.g., D4, C4, p4g).
- Generate music synchronized with visual patterns.
- Support for multiple scales, instruments, and transformations.
- Interactive GUI with controls for playback speed, mode, and more.
- Works on desktop and mobile devices (except for some known Safari speaker issues).

#### **6. Usage**

```markdown
## **Usage**
1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Use the GUI to:
   - Select symmetry types (e.g., D4, C4).
   - Choose scales and instruments for music generation.
   - Adjust playback speed and mode.
3. Click **Play** to start the music and visuals.

## **Technologies Used**
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) - Creative coding library for visual patterns.
- [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) - Library for generative music.
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript - Standard web technologies.

## **Configuration**
- Modify `sketch.js` to customize behavior:
  - Add new symmetry types or scales.
  - Change instrument configurations.
  - Adjust pattern generation logic.


## **Known Issues**
- **Mobile Safari:** The app may not play sound through speakers unless headphones are connected.
- **Delay in Play-Pause:** Minor delays can occur if multiple events stack up during pause/resume.
